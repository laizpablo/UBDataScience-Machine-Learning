    "This combination can consist in any kind of network, but often is a combination of Fully Connected and Convolutional Networks.\n",

    "- **Generative network**: the task associated is to generate content.\n",

    "The idea behind is to use the ability of the discriminating network to correctly predict the data soruce (real or created) is then used as the error for the generating network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact produce that the networks compete, where the discriminator is getting better at distinguishing real data from non-real data. And the generator is learning to falsify better the data.\n",

    "This kind of network can be difficult to train, because we have two networks to train with their own problems."
